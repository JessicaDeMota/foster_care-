- With 21% of students in the foster care system overall having an equivalency rather than the annual 67% and 3% obtaining a college degree, However, due to COVID - 19, the Administration for Childrens Services were able to get $9 million to stay afloat, and haven't seend further funding been expanded. This program will go up to the age of 26. - On top of this, as well 90% of foster care children in New York were Latin American or African American.

## Libraries/ Modules  Used:

Bokeh = Bokeh is another data visualization library that is provides high performance intereactive charts and plots. It can be utilized in different formats such as notebooks and html. It is further used for building out simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. 

MatPlotLib =  Matplotlib is used for interactive visualizations that are static and animated 



## Hypothesis:
There's a large percentage of students in the foster care system in New York that never graduate due to the abuse and neglect that they face in the system. In comparison to New Jersey, New York needs improvement in regards to the way social case workers manage abuse and neglect to decrease the amount of students who are not on track to graudate by senior year. By managing the school budgeting and improving the abuse and neglect in the system we will increase the educational contunity in the system. 

## Errors in Our Dataset:
- In our New Jersey dataset, there are errors due to the dataset only analyzing the ages between 13-17 and not 18-19 in comparison to New York City which considers students who take a longer time to recieve their GED. 
- New Jersey also analyzes their data by counties, while New York City gets more miniscule looking into a larger spread of neighborhoods, by analyzing Community Districts. 

## Conclusions Drawn :

- This data can be utilized to determine which Community Districts need a better social case worker adjustments with the open investigations that remain with abuse and neglect in the system. 
- This dataset, can also work further to establishing a healther relationship between high school and educational contunity with those in the Foster Care System. 
- We are also able to comprehend how money that is being used for City Comptrollers can be utilized for vocational training for educational contunity for those pursuing their high school GED or have no experience.
